Microsoft is laying off thousands of employees, its third round of cuts in recent months, the company confirmed on Wednesday. The staff reduction will affect less than 4% of the company’s total workforce, or around 9,000 workers, according to a company spokesperson. It marks the tech giant’s largest layoffs since it cut 10,000 employees in 2023 and comes amid workforce cuts elsewhere in the tech industry.
